# YesPowerR32 - A Modified YesPower for Dogemone

YesPowerR32 is a variant of the YesPower Proof-of-Work (PoW) algorithm optimized for Dogemone. This algorithm integrates **Blake256** for hashing instead of SHA256, enhancing its cryptographic properties and ASIC resistance.

## Key Features
- **Blake256** as the hashing function for improved efficiency and ASIC resistance.
- Supports lightweight implementation for CPU-friendly mining.
- Enhanced performance optimizations for modern hardware.

## Differences Between YesPower and YesPowerR32
| Feature                   | YesPower          | YesPowerR32        |
|---------------------------|-------------------|--------------------|
| Hashing Function          | SHA256            | Blake256           |
| ASIC Resistance           | High              | Higher             |
| Final SMix2 Optimization  | Standard          | Custom for Blake256 |
