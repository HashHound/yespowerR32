Integration of YesPowerR32 Algorithm:

Dogemone transitioned from its previous Proof-of-Work algorithm to yespowerr32 for enhanced ASIC resistance and better GPU/CPU mining compatibility.
YesPowerR32 now employs Blake256 as the primary hashing function instead of SHA256, providing stronger cryptographic security and performance.
Optimized BlockMix in YesPowerR32:

Implemented optimizations for BlockMix to ensure faster computation for miners.
Special handling for duplicate indices during final SMix2 invocation to enhance reliability for blocks with N=2048.
Fail-Safe Buffer Handling:

Modified PoW hash computation to fill the destination buffer with zeros in case of an error.
Ensures fail-safe operation during mining or PoW verification and protects against potential issues in < target checks.
